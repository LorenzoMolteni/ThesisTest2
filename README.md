Android Studio code for my thesys

My thesys aims to develop a smartphone interface for nudging people towards a better understanding of their actions while they are using social network.

This interface is based on an AccessibilityService, running in the background, that is able to collect information about what the user does on his social networks 
(i.e. # of scrolls, #of pulls, etc) and then provides nudges for empowering the user and improving his knowledge about the dark patterns used by social media to grab
his attention
